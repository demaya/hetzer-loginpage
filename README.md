# Hetzner Reseller Personalization Example

This repository contains example HTML files to demonstrate the customization options available for Hetzner resellers, adhering to the guidelines provided in the [Hetzner Documentation](https://docs.hetzner.com/konsoleh/server-management/resellers/reseller-personalization).

## Overview

Hetzner offers resellers the ability to personalize their server management interface to align with their branding. This repository includes two examples:

1. **Login Page**: A custom login page design that resellers can use as a template for their own login pages.
2. **Index Page**: An index page that displays a welcome message and the customers domain name automatically using the `__DOMAIN__` placeholder.

Both pages are designed with simplicity in mind and demonstrate the use of basic HTML and CSS for customization.

## Features

- Custom login page with form inputs for username and password.
- Index page with an automated personalization feature that displays the reseller's logo.
- Use of a placeholder (`__DOMAIN__`) that Hetzner automatically replaces with the customers domain name.
- Example of how to include branding with the [Y-Progress logo](https://y-progress.de) in both pages.

## Usage

To use these templates:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Optionally, replace the logo URL in both HTML files with your own branding logo.
3. Customize the HTML and CSS according to your branding needs, keeping the `__DOMAIN__` placeholder intact for automatic domain name insertion by Hetzner.
4. Upload the modified files to Hetzner's backend, following the structure and guidelines provided by Hetzner for reseller personalization.

## Note

These examples are intended as starting points. It's important to thoroughly test any modifications on your server to ensure compatibility and proper functionality.
